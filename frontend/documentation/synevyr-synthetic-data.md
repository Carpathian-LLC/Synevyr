### TL;DR

Synevyr includes a **synthetic data engine** that creates realistic but anonymized customer, lead, and e-commerce records.  
This allows teams to explore the analytics platform end-to-end **without connecting sensitive business systems**.

## What Is Synthetic Data?

Synthetic data is **artificially generated information** that simulates the structure and behavior of real-world business activity.  
It is not linked to actual customers, yet it behaves like authentic marketing and e-commerce data.  

Synevyr generates synthetic data for:  
- **Customers** (profiles, demographics, activity status)  
- **Marketing Leads** (attribution to ad platforms and campaigns)  
- **E-commerce Orders** (purchases, totals, and order outcomes)  
- **Aggregate Metrics** (customer lifetime value, churn events, funnel conversion paths)

## How the Data Is Generated

The generation process establishes a **full customer journey**, from first exposure to an ad through to becoming a repeat buyer.  

1. **Customer Profiles**  
   - Synthetic identities with realistic names, locations, and contact details.  
   - Activity states (active, inactive, pending) distributed to reflect real-world ratios.  

2. **Leads and Attribution**  
   - Simulated marketing leads are tied to platforms such as Meta, Google, and LinkedIn.  
   - Ads, campaigns, and referrers are included to model acquisition channels.  

3. **Orders and Purchases**  
   - Synthetic order histories are created with varied purchase amounts, statuses, and repeat behavior.  
   - Biases are applied to mimic differences between organic, paid, and referral customers.  

4. **Lifecycle and Behavior Modeling**  
   - Customer ‚Äútenure‚Äù (days active before churn) is varied by channel.  
   - Churn, reactivation, and retention patterns reflect realistic marketing dynamics.  
   - Lifetime spend values are tuned to simulate a real dataset without exposing private information.

## Why Synthetic Data Matters

- **Safe Testing**: Enables full analytics testing without exposing real customer data.  
- **Demonstration Ready**: Dashboards can be previewed with meaningful metrics from day one.  
- **Comparability**: Mirrors real-world marketing funnels and revenue flows for realistic evaluation.  
- **Privacy First**: No sensitive or identifiable personal data is used.  

---

## Governance & Compliance

- **Anonymity**: All generated records are synthetic and carry no personal risk.  
- **Alignment**: Behavioral patterns are modeled only at a statistical level, not copied from individuals.
