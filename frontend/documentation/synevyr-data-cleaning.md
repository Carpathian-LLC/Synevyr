## What Is the Data Cleaning Pipeline?

The **Data Cleaning Pipeline** is the foundation of the Synevyr analytics platform.  
It transforms raw records from advertising platforms, CRM systems, and e-commerce stores into **structured, reliable datasets**.  

Goals:  
- Remove inconsistencies in formatting and time zones  
- Normalize labels across different sources  
- Handle missing or malformed fields gracefully  
- Aggregate activity into **daily snapshots** for each channel  

The result is a **single source of truth** for evaluating marketing performance.

## Key Steps in Cleaning

1. **Standardization**  
   - Converts currencies into a consistent format (e.g., dollars and cents)  
   - Aligns timestamps into UTC for comparability across regions  

2. **Normalization**  
   - Maps platform-specific labels (e.g., ‚ÄúFB Ads,‚Äù ‚ÄúMeta,‚Äù ‚ÄúInstagram‚Äù) into unified source categories  
   - Ensures customer IDs and order references match across systems  

3. **Validation**  
   - Filters out incomplete or corrupted records  
   - Cross-checks that totals (e.g., ad spend, order revenue) align with raw platform reports  

4. **Aggregation**  
   - Buckets events into **daily summaries** per user and channel  
   - Tracks leads, conversions, churn events, revenue, and spend
